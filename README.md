# Inverse17
Computational and Variational Methods for Inverse Problems
Fall 2017
Professor: Omar Ghattas
Instructor: Umberto Villa

Description from the syllabus:
This course provides an introduction to the numerical solution of inverse problems
that are governed by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). The focus of the course
is on variational formulations, ill-posedness, regularization, variational discretization, and largescale
solution algorithms for inverse problems. Students will develop numerical implementations
for model problems using an inverse problems library, hIPPYlib, along with a high-level finite
element toolkit, FEniCS. These implementations will allow us to study the influence of data noise,
regularization, the observation operator, the choice of the parameter field, and the nature of
the underlying PDE model on the identifiability of the model parameters, as well as facilitating
experimentation with different solution algorithms.
